2,"CRISP-DM(CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) has its origins in the second half of the nineties and is thus about two decades old. According to many surveys and user polls it is still the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. However, undoubtedly the field has moved on considerably in twenty years, with data science now the leading term being favoured over data mining. In this paper we investigate whether, and in what contexts, CRISP-DM is still fit for purpose for data science projects. We argue that if the project is goal-directed and process-driven the process model view still largely holds. On the other hand, when data science projects become more exploratory the paths that the project can take become more varied, and a more flexible model is called for. We suggest what the outlines of such a trajectory-based model might look like and how it can be used to categorise data science projects (goal-directed, exploratory or data management). We examine seven real-life exemplars where exploratory activities play an important role and compare them against 51 use cases extracted from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group. We anticipate this categorisation can help project planning in terms of time and cost characteristics.",crispdmcrossindustry standard process data mining origin second half ninety thus two decade old according many survey user poll still de facto standard developing data mining knowledge discovery project however undoubtedly field moved considerably twenty year data science leading term favoured data mining in paper investigate whether context crispdm still fit purpose data science project we argue project goaldirected processdriven process model view still largely hold on hand data science project become exploratory path project take become varied flexible model called we suggest outline trajectorybased model might look like used categorise data science project goaldirected exploratory data management we examine seven reallife exemplar exploratory activity play important role compare use case extracted nist big data public working group we anticipate categorisation help project planning term time cost characteristic
3,"The digital world has a wealth of data, such as internet of things (IoT) data, business data, health data, mobile data, urban data, security data, and many more, in the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0 or 4IR). Extracting knowledge or useful insights from these data can be used for smart decision-making in various applications domains. In the area of data science, advanced analytics methods including machine learning modeling can provide actionable insights or deeper knowledge about data, which makes the computing process automatic and smart. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “Data Science” including various types of advanced analytics methods that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application through smart decision-making in different scenarios. We also discuss and summarize ten potential real-world application domains including business, healthcare, cybersecurity, urban and rural data science, and so on by taking into account data-driven smart computing and decision making. Based on this, we finally highlight the challenges and potential research directions within the scope of our study. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a reference point on data science and advanced analytics to the researchers and decision-makers as well as application developers, particularly from the data-driven solution point of view for real-world problems.",the digital world wealth data internet thing iot data business data health data mobile data urban data security data many current age fourth industrial revolution industry ir extracting knowledge useful insight data used smart decisionmaking various application domain in area data science advanced analytics method including machine learning modeling provide actionable insight deeper knowledge data make computing process automatic smart in paper present comprehensive view data science including various type advanced analytics method applied enhance intelligence capability application smart decisionmaking different scenario we also discus summarize ten potential realworld application domain including business healthcare cybersecurity urban rural data science taking account datadriven smart computing decision making based finally highlight challenge potential research direction within scope study overall paper aim serve reference point data science advanced analytics researcher decisionmakers well application developer particularly datadriven solution point view realworld problem
4,"Data science (DS) projects often follow a lifecycle that consists of laborious tasks for data scientists and domain experts (e.g., data exploration, model training, etc.). Only till recently, machine learning(ML) researchers have developed promising automation techniques to aid data workers in these tasks. This paper introduces AutoDS, an automated machine learning (AutoML) system that aims to leverage the latest ML automation techniques to support data science projects. Data workers only need to upload their dataset, then the system can automatically suggest ML configurations, preprocess data, select algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface. Our goal is to offer a systematic investigation of user interaction and perceptions of using an AutoDS system in solving a data science task. We studied AutoDS with 30 professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not, to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet surprisingly, we find that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality and less errors, but lower human confidence scores. We reflect on the findings by presenting design implications for incorporating automation techniques into human work in the data science lifecycle.",data science d project often follow lifecycle consists laborious task data scientist domain expert eg data exploration model training etc only till recently machine learningml researcher developed promising automation technique aid data worker task this paper introduces autods automated machine learning automl system aim leverage latest ml automation technique support data science project data worker need upload dataset system automatically suggest ml configuration preprocess data select algorithm train model these suggestion presented user via webbased graphical user interface notebookbased programming user interface our goal offer systematic investigation user interaction perception using autods system solving data science task we studied autods professional data scientist one group used autods complete data science project a expected autods improves productivity yet surprisingly find model produced autods group higher quality le error lower human confidence score we reflect finding presenting design implication incorporating automation technique human work data science lifecycle
5,"The goal of Optimal Transport (OT) is to define geometric tools that are useful to compare probability distributions. Their use dates back to 1781. Recent years have witnessed a new revolution in the spread of OT, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This monograph reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications. Computational Optimal Transport presents an overview of the main theoretical insights that support the practical effectiveness of OT before explaining how to turn these insights into fast computational schemes. Written for readers at all levels, the authors provide descriptions of foundational theory at two-levels. Generally accessible to all readers, more advanced readers can read the specially identified more general mathematical expositions of optimal transport tailored for discrete measures. Furthermore, several chapters deal with the interplay between continuous and discrete measures, and are thus targeting a more mathematically-inclined audience. This monograph will be a valuable reference for researchers and students wishing to get a thorough understanding of Computational Optimal Transport, a mathematical gem at the interface of probability, analysis and optimization.",the goal optimal transport ot define geometric tool useful compare probability distribution their use date back recent year witnessed new revolution spread ot thanks emergence approximate solver scale size dimension relevant data science thanks newfound scalability ot increasingly used unlock various problem imaging science color texture processing computer vision graphic shape manipulation machine learning regression classification density fitting this monograph review ot bias toward numerical method application data science shed light theoretical property ot make particularly useful application computational optimal transport present overview main theoretical insight support practical effectiveness ot explaining turn insight fast computational scheme written reader level author provide description foundational theory twolevels generally accessible reader advanced reader read specially identified general mathematical exposition optimal transport tailored discrete measure furthermore several chapter deal interplay continuous discrete measure thus targeting mathematicallyinclined audience this monograph valuable reference researcher student wishing get thorough understanding computational optimal transport mathematical gem interface probability analysis optimization

9,"Computer science as an academic discipline began in the 1960’s. Emphasis was on programming languages, compilers, operating systems, and the mathematical theory that supported these areas. Courses in theoretical computer science covered finite automata, regular expressions, context-free languages, and computability. In the 1970’s, the study of algorithms was added as an important component of theory. The emphasis was on making computers useful. Today, a fundamental change is taking place and the focus is more on applications. There are many reasons for this change. The merging of computing and communications has played an important role. The enhanced ability to observe, collect, and store data in the natural sciences, in commerce, and in other fields calls for a change in our understanding of data and how to handle it in the modern setting. The emergence of the web and social networks as central aspects of daily life presents both opportunities and challenges for theory.",computer science academic discipline began emphasis programming language compiler operating system mathematical theory supported area course theoretical computer science covered finite automaton regular expression contextfree language computability in study algorithm added important component theory the emphasis making computer useful today fundamental change taking place focus application there many reason change the merging computing communication played important role the enhanced ability observe collect store data natural science commerce field call change understanding data handle modern setting the emergence web social network central aspect daily life present opportunity challenge theory
